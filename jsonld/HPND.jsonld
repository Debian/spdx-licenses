  "comment" : "This license has been voluntarily deprecated by its author. Per the copy of this license at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/HPND Explanation: * Angle brackets hold \"fields\", e.g. <copyright holder>. * Square brackets hold optional text, e.g. [or <related entities>]. * A license can have variations in capitalization and whitespace, and still be considered an instance of this template. It may be possible to construct a grammatically incorrect license from this template, or one that lacks a disclaimer, or one that includes a double-disclaimer. That is acceptable, as long as it remains impossible to construct a non-OSD-compliant license that matches the pattern.",
