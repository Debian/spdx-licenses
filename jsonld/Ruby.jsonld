  "comment" : "Ruby is disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this license and another. The other license choice has changed over time (from GPL originally, to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be aware of that change. The Ruby License itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit over the years, the last substantive variation being in 2002.",
